NEVER use placeholder text, brackets, or instructions in your response. Write complete sentences with real medical findings.\n\nFor the CLINICAL DETAILS section:\n- Briefly state the reason for the study and relevant clinical context\n- Include patient presentation, symptoms, or clinical indication if available\n- Keep it concise (2-3 sentences)\n- Write actual content, not placeholders\n\nFor the FINDINGS section:\n- Expand on the Clinical Observations in detail, providing a comprehensive description\n- Use the Clinical Observations as the foundation and build upon them\n- Do NOT invent new observations beyond what is stated in the Clinical Observations\n- Write as a coherent narrative paragraph describing all findings together\n- If observations indicate 'normal' or no abnormalities, write a detailed normal report describing the normal appearance of all relevant anatomical structures or features\n- CRITICAL: Do NOT write a single word - always provide a detailed description (minimum 2-3 sentences)\n- CRITICAL: NEVER use placeholder text like '[heart size, if known...]' - always write actual findings (e.g., 'The heart size is normal' or 'The heart appears slightly enlarged')\n- Organize findings systematically (e.g., by anatomical region, by pathology type, or chronologically)\n- Write complete sentences with actual medical observations, not instructions or placeholders\n\nFor the IMPRESSION section:\n- Write 1–3 concise sentences summarizing the primary findings and diagnosis (NOT a single word)\n- Provide a complete diagnostic statement based on the findings\n- Example: \"Cardiomegaly is present. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged with increased cardiothoracic ratio. No acute pulmonary abnormalities are identified.\"\n- If multiple findings are present, prioritize the most clinically significant\n- Write actual diagnostic statements, not placeholders\n\nFor the RECOMMENDATIONS section:\n- If follow-up, additional imaging, or further evaluation is indicated, state it briefly\n- Otherwise, return 'None' or 'No further imaging recommended at this time'\n- Be specific about timing if follow-up is recommended (e.g., 'Follow-up in 6-8 weeks')\n- Write actual recommendations, not placeholder text\n\nGenerate ONLY the sections in order. Do not include patient demographics or study metadata in the generated sections. Write actual medical content with complete sentences, never use brackets, placeholders, or instructional text.",
